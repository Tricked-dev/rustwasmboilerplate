## Wasm Boilerplate Rust

This is a pure wasm without wasm_bindgen example to get started with wasm including making a promise based api and accepting buffers and returning them.

It creates wasm binaries that are less than 200kb by default due to the optimization options applied to cargo.

Having smaller wasm binary size makes loading them faster.

btw i have no idea what im doing when writing wasm and rust and if you have better ways to do anything in this repo please make a pull request or issue so other people can benefit from your knowledge
